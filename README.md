First, create your own custom business card, including your name, job title, phone number, email, company, address, and website. 

Then, share your card with others by generating a QR code and sharing it with them. They can then scan the QR code using our built-in scanner. 
Easily manage and access all scanned cards with our powerful list feature, including the ability to share, add to contacts, start WhatsApp chats, and visit their website. Plus, remove cards you no longer need.

Say goodbye to cluttered wallets and forgotten business cards. With Tap-n-Connect, you'll always have the information you need at your fingertips. 
Try it out now and experience the convenience for yourself! üöÄ
